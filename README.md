## About the Python Template

Nbg's Python template is a minimal host template that serves a simple .html index page

That page is consisted by three links which you can click and then a python script is called which makes a call to NBG's API

In order to create your personal sandbox in your project you need to change the REPLACE_THIS_VALUE parameter of the app.py file to match your personal data

The output of the scripts isn't visible in the public url of your project, but it is, in the server logs

Have fun coding in your browser!
